Hello,
Most of the documentation is in the physical folder handed in to you. In addition, the typed portion of the documentation is also available in the documentation folder of the software solution.

However, there is also documentation that is hosted externally due to the nature of the development process. This is the changelog documentation, and it is hosted on the website GitHub. As the software solution is public, you will be able to review all aspects of the project there as well.

The changelog is located here: https://github.com/WhalesAreDelicious/Conquest2/commits/master

The project as a whole is located here: https://github.com/WhalesAreDelicious/Conquest2/

To see what has been changed in each version iteration, click on the title of the version to see the changes made. For example, click on the "Beta 0.9 (preparation for release candidate status)" link to see changes made in that version.

Thank you!
